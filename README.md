Finite differences model of temporal drug diffusion in a multilayered arterial wall.

Conservation of drug in the advecting fluid and tissue are modelled as done in Abraham et al.  

However, instead of homogeneous wall structure, we apply a multilayered arterial wall model to the spacial grid solved with finite differences. Motivation for the multilayered model and physical constansts are inspired by Jesionek et al.
